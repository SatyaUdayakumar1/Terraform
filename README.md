This Terraform project configures a robust AWS infrastructure to support a web application or microservices architecture. It utilizes custom modules to create a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) with public and private subnets spread across multiple availability zones (AZs) to ensure high availability. The project includes modules for setting up security groups to manage inbound and outbound traffic for different resources, such as databases and web applications. Additionally, an RDS module is employed to create a managed database instance with customizable parameters. Additionally, it features a Launch Template module to provision two templates: one for the web tier and another for the application tier. After creating the templates, the project launches four EC2 instances using them, with two instances dedicated to each tier in every availability zone. The web instances act as proxy servers, redirecting browser requests to the application instances. The application tier hosts the running application, which retrieves data from the RDS instance and sends it back to the browser upon receiving requests. This design ensures seamless communication and scalability, enabling efficient handling of user traffic between the web and application tiers.

In addition to the infrastructure setup, this project automates the deployment of the application on the application instances. It achieves this by utilizing user data in the form of bash scripts. These scripts also configure the httpd proxy server on the web instances. As a result, the application is efficiently deployed and accessible through the proxy server, ensuring a smooth user experience.
